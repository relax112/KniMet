The LIPID MAPS Structure Database (version updated on the 6th of December 2016) was filtered to keep only one entry for all the stereo- and diastereo-isomers belonging to the same lipid sub-class. 
The list of isomers can be found in the file LMSDF_Isomers.tsv, where the first column contains the ID of the compound kept in the database, while the following corresponds to its isomers.
The StructMapping and Mapping file will only contain one entry per isomer, namely the compound contained in the first column of LMSDF_Isomers.tsv.
